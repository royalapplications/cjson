# cJSON

Contains scripts to build "Apple-Universal" static libraries of cJSON. Also packages everything up into an XCFramework for easy consumption with Swift packages or Xcode.
Release names refer to the cJSON version used during compilation. You can append an internal suffix after "-" (e.g., 1.7.19-2); the suffix is included in output folder names but ignored when downloading cJSON sources.
